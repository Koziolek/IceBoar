# How to build a project?
 
IceBoar samples contains 3 maven modules:

* ice-boar-hello-world-swing - Contains a simple standalone Java Swing application which displays JFrame with a text 
box. This application demonstrates that ice-boar can start another Java application on different JVM and deal with 
its properties. 
* ice-boar-demo - Contains a sample web application to show how ice-boar might be used in other projects.
* ice-boar-demo-gh-pages - A better version of ice-boar-demo. It builds a single WAR file with all necessary content. 
This project is easier to use. It is deployed to: http://roche.github.io/IceBoar/
